<h1>Project Andromeda - Pentesting</h1>

<h2>Project Summary</h2>
The purpose of this pen test is to identify any vulnerabilities that rely on the Andromeda network and exploit them to gain access. This is a grey-box pen test where I was provided with the network ID which is 192.168.200.0/24. The report will highlight those vulnerabilities, explain them in detail and along with tactics used to exploit them. Furthermore, the tools that were used in this penetration test included Nmap, Metasploit and theHarvester. The expectation of Andromeda penetration test is a full list of vulnerabilities found, risk analysis associated with each vulnerability and risk level accordingly. In addition to that extensive system identification, IOCs used in detail and finally an action plan to remediate the issues found in the network.

<p> Using NMAP to scan the network, five systmes of interest were mainly discovered. The IP addresses, open ports and services running were discovered through the scans.</p>
